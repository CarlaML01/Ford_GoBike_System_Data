This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. Data Wrangling was performed to correct datatype, missing values, and create columns for investigations.



## Summary of Findings

1- Bike trips are more frequent on weekdays, particularly on Thursday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, indicating a preference for commuting or weekday activities.

2- There is a significant gender disparity in bike usage, with males accounting for approximately three times the number of female users.

3- The majority of bike service customers are subscribed members, highlighting the importance of subscriber loyalty and the benefits of subscription-based models.

4- Users are primarily in the 30-40-year-old age range, with the average age being around 38 years old. This suggests that the service appeals predominantly to individuals in their late 20s to early 40s.

5- Most bike trips have a duration between 3 and 20 minutes, indicating that the service is primarily used for short-distance travel or quick trips within the city.
